# Drone-detection-dataset
Dataset containing IR, visible and audio data that can be used to train and evaluate drone detection sensors and systems.

Video labels: Airplane, Bird, Drone and Helicopter.
Audio labels: Drone, Helicopter and Background.

The dataset contains 90 audio clips and 650 videos (365 IR and 285 visible). If all images are extracted from all the videos the dataset has a total of 203328 annotated images.

Free to download, use and edit.
Descriptions of the videos are found in "Video_dataset_description.xlsx".
The videos can be used as they are, or together with the respective label-files.
The annotations are in .mat-format and have been done using the Matlab video labeler.
Some instructions and examples are found in "Create_a_dataset_from_videos_and_labels.m"
